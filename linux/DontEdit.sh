HelpMessage="+++++++++++++++ Programs Used ++++++++++++++++
This program will help you crack passwords.
It has two programs inside it: Hydra and Nmap.

+++++++++++++++ How to Use ++++++++++++++++++
To use the program, you have to tell the computer what port you want to scan.
It will then scan the port that you asked for on the network and see if any ports are open.

If there are any ports that are open, it will ask for a username and hostname.
When you provide the username and hostname, it will try to crack the given parameters."
